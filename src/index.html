              <p class="article__post-description">
                Divers are really astronauts; gliding weightless through the ocean we observe alien worlds carpeted
                in vast fields of colourful corals with equally bizarre, enthralling inhabitants - from the foreign
                clicks of dolphins communicating to minute technicolour slugs (nudibranch). And best yet, you don't need
                years of gruelling training or a rocket to experience these watery worlds, just four days and a
                eagle-ray-eyed (sorry) ground control.

              <p class="article__post-description">
                As the nights draw in, the temperature drops (we had a good run) and businesses start to compete for
                the best Christmas TV ad (move aside Elton, Waitrose's Stollen takes the crown), the festive season is
                upon us. So, naturally, we've decided to bypass all of that and look straight ahead to next year, which is
                shaping up to be a good'un. From a very exclusive expedition to the best new openings and
                off-the-beaten track diving adventures.

                As we (at least those of us based in Europe) are slowly stepping into the cold of winter and dusting
                off our winter clothing, here at Original Diving, we've compiled our list of some top short-haul
                winter-come-spring diving destinations. Here's a selection of places you can get to for a short break
                where the temperature won't chill your bones and the waters remain unfrozen. Enjoy!

                This year I turn 30. At the start of the year I decided that it was going to be a big year for me;
                figure out my five year plan, set some challenges, say 'yes' to as much as possible and go on some
                unforgettable trips. The five year plan is still a work in progress, however I did say 'yes' to
                completing a ski marathon so that doubled with a challenge.

              Our approach differs from other travel companies; we are a group of dedicated divers, marine biologists
              and
              travellers who take a creative approach to tailoring luxury diving holidays.
            </p>
            <p class="about-us__text">
              We focus on understanding what you want from your holiday, from trips centred entirely around diving to
              holidays with the odd dive included here and there. No matter your level of dive experience and
              knowledge,
              we will tailor the perfect holiday to your requirements using a thoughtful approach, focused on the small
              details that make a big difference.
            </p>
            <p class="about-us__text">
              Our aim is to make sure every detail of your holiday is planned to perfection by working with you to hone
              and finesse your itinerary to your exact requirements, from ensuring logistics like transfers and guides
              run like clockwork to giving you access to experiences the average traveller wouldn't find. So you can
              sit
              back, relax and enjoy your Original Diving holiday.
